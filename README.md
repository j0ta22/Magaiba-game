# Classic Arcade Game Clone
___

This is a Udacity Front-end Nanodegree project, part of my Google Scholarship. The idea is to recreate a simple clone of the classic Frogger arcade game.

## How to play

Click on this link to play the game:

__*************__ [Cross the Buggy Road](https://syknapse.github.io/arcade_game_fend/) __*************__

Use the arrow keys to move your player across the bug infested road and reach the safety of the Great Blue Bug Free sector. Score 1 point for each successful crossing. Watch-out!! The bugs fight back and score points against you every time they run you over. They also get angrier and meaner the more wins you score.

## Features

+ Game has 8 levels of ascending difficulty factor.
+ Player respawns on a random starting block.
+ Enemies have random speeds and random time between screen exit and respawn within a range that becomes harder each level.
+ Wins counter and a losses counter
+ A central display with playing instructions, new level information, random win or loss phrases, win/loss animations

## Tech

Vanilla JS
Object-oriented programming

## Installation

If you would like to install this game on your device you can clone or download this repo. Once you have the project folder all you have to do is launch the `index.html`file in your browser (you can find an option to do so by right-clicking on the file). Enjoy

## Acknowledgements

Of course I couldn't have done this without the great help by many of the current and past FEND nanodegree students.
